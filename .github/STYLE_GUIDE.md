# Writing Guidelines

These guidelines ensure consistency and readability across all project content.

## Text Style

### Punctuation

- Avoid long dashes (em dashes). Use commas, periods, or parentheses instead.
- Minimize regular dashes. Rewrite sentences to avoid them when possible.
- Use clear, direct sentences.

**Instead of:**
> Teachers must master AI skills — critical thinking, ethics, and adaptability — to guide students effectively.

**Write:**
> Teachers must master AI skills (critical thinking, ethics, and adaptability) to guide students effectively.

**Or even better:**
> Teachers must master AI skills such as critical thinking, ethics, and adaptability to guide students effectively.

### Tone

- Professional but approachable
- Active voice preferred
- Avoid jargon when simpler words work
- Write for educators, not technologists

### Formatting

- Short paragraphs (3 to 5 sentences max)
- Use headings to break up long content
- Bullet points for lists of 3 or more items
- Bold for emphasis, sparingly

### Emojis

- Do not use emojis in the website content or code
- This includes decorative icons, bullet replacements, or visual markers
- Only add emojis if specifically requested

## Why This Matters

Content that relies heavily on dashes, complex punctuation, or emojis can appear machine generated. Natural writing uses varied sentence structures and straightforward punctuation.

## Review Checklist

Before committing content changes:

1. Read the text aloud. Does it sound natural?
2. Count the dashes. Can any be removed?
3. Check for overly long sentences. Break them up.
4. Verify all links work when opened from File Explorer.
