# Embodied Competence in the AI Era
### Must Educators Practice the "Human Operating System" to Teach It?

---

## The Core Question

The debate in AI education has moved beyond *"Should we teach AI?"* to a deeper dilemma:

> **Is it enough for teachers to understand the five "Human Operating System" competencies and design activities around them (Option A)?  
> Or must teachers live these competencies, practice them, fail, correct course, and demonstrate real time judgment while working with AI (Option B)?**

The five competencies form a coordinated system that keeps learners acting as agents rather than becoming passive consumers of AI generated text:

1. **Question Formulation and Inquiry Discipline**
2. **Critical Evaluation of AI Output**
3. **Ethical Judgment and Responsible Use**
4. **Adaptive Learning Under Uncertainty**
5. **Keeping the Human Above the Machine**

The difference is between *knowing about* a competency (I can define what it means) and *knowing how to do it under pressure* (I can demonstrate it live, in real time, while 30 students watch). The research points to a clear answer: **teachers need at least a meaningful level of embodied practice**, what we call **"sufficient embodiment" (B-lite)**, to make all five competencies real for students rather than rhetorical.

## Why This Matters Now

### AI as "Surrogate Knower"

Generative AI systems act as an alternative knowledge source in the classroom. They produce fluent, confident sounding text, even when wrong. This structurally undermines the teacher's traditional role as "the one who knows."

The teacher's legitimacy shifts: **from "I have the answers" to "I can show you how to question, verify, judge, and hold uncertainty."** This is what researchers call becoming an *epistemic mentor*, someone who teaches how knowledge is justified, not just delivered.

> See: [Epistemic Authority and Generative AI in Learning Spaces](https://doi.org/10.3389/feduc.2025.1647687) (Jose et al., 2025), on how GenAI disrupts knowledge authority in classrooms.

### Cognitive Offloading: The Hidden Threat

Emerging research (2023 to 2026) shows a concerning pattern: frequent AI use correlates with decreased critical thinking behaviors, mediated by *cognitive offloading*, the tendency to delegate mental effort to the tool.

A [Microsoft Research study](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/the-impact-of-generative-ai-on-critical-thinking/) of 319 knowledge workers found that higher AI usage was associated with lower critical thinking engagement, particularly when the system was perceived as trustworthy.

> **Key caveat:** Most of these studies are correlational, not causal. But the mechanism is psychologically plausible and the pattern is consistent across studies.

**What this means for teachers:** If even experienced adults slip into uncritical reliance, teachers who haven't personally navigated the temptation of cognitive offloading will struggle to recognize or counter it in students. This affects not just critical evaluation, but all five competencies: the pull of easy answers discourages questioning, erodes ethical reflection, undermines adaptive learning, and shifts human agency toward the machine.

### The Theoretical Foundation

Two foundational frameworks underpin the argument across all five competencies:

**[Cognitive apprenticeship](https://www.aft.org/ae/winter1991/collins_brown_holum)** (Collins, Brown & Holum, 1991) describes learning complex skills through modeling, coaching, scaffolding, fading, articulation, reflection, and exploration. The central thesis: in cognitive skills, the gap between novice and expert isn't just "more knowledge" but a set of invisible control and judgment strategies. Teaching must make these visible. In an AI saturated classroom, **someone has to demonstrate what each competency looks like in action.** If the teacher hasn't practiced it, the modeling function breaks down.

**[Bandura's social learning theory](https://doi.org/10.1037/h0032848)** shows that students internalize norms and processes by watching behavior, especially when that behavior includes attention cues, strategy selection, and error correction. Students will learn "what counts as intellectual work" from what the teacher actually does with AI. **The hidden curriculum is in the teacher's behavior**, and it affects all five competencies simultaneously.

## The Five Competencies: Why Each Requires Embodiment

### 1. Question Formulation and Inquiry Discipline

In an AI world, answers are cheap. AI can produce a response in seconds. The value lies in **the questions we pose** and how we refine them. This competency covers the skill of asking clear, focused, open ended questions to drive learning rather than just seeking answers.

Meta-analyses on inquiry based learning in science show that inquiry has strong positive effects, but with a critical caveat: **unstructured inquiry without guidance leaves students with an interesting activity but no thinking tools.** "Less guidance" does not automatically mean "more independence." The teacher must mediate and model what inquiry looks like.

In AI rich environments, the risk escalates: if "exploring with AI" becomes trial and error without mediation, students optimize for product (a polished text or solution) instead of process (genuine investigation and verification). The default flow becomes "prompt, accept, move on" rather than "question, refine, verify, question again."

**Why embodiment matters:** A teacher who has practiced questioning AI outputs knows from experience how a vague question produces misleading confidence, how rephrasing reveals gaps, and how a question can be turned into a verification chain. Without this lived experience, instruction stays at the level of "ask good questions" rather than showing the messy, iterative reality of inquiry.

> Research by [Salomon & Perkins](https://doi.org/10.1207/s15326985ep2402_1) on learning transfer shows that skills don't move from one context to another automatically. Transfer requires "hugging" (practicing close to real conditions), "bridging" (explicit metacognitive reflection), and demonstration of what "the move" looks like across settings. Teachers need to model the entire arc: from confusion to clarity to verification.

### 2. Critical Evaluation of AI Output

This is the ability to evaluate information generated by AI: spotting errors, biases, hallucinations, and distinguishing confident sounding text from accurate text. It is essentially critical thinking and information literacy applied to a new kind of source.

Large meta-analyses on critical thinking instruction show that explicit teaching of strategies (analysis, evaluation, justification) produces stronger effects than "immersion," meaning simply hoping students develop critical thinking through content exposure.

> See: [Abrami et al., 2015, Meta-analysis on critical thinking instruction](https://doi.org/10.3102/0034654314551063)

Research on lateral reading (from fact checkers like those studied by Sam Wineburg at Stanford) shows that experts don't "read deeply" within a source. They open multiple tabs, compare claims, search for context, and verify against external sources. This is exactly the "anti-hallucination protocol" students need when working with AI.

A [2025 study on "inoculation training"](https://doi.org/10.1177/02734753251319559) (Zarzosa & Ruvalcaba, 2025) found that targeted training can increase both *intentions to verify* and *actual verification behavior* in educational tasks.

**Why embodiment matters:** It is nearly impossible to build "epistemic suspicion" in students without having personally encountered convincing, well formatted AI errors. A teacher who hasn't experienced how AI can produce fluent, citation-laden text that turns out to be fabricated will stay at the level of "check your sources," a generic instruction that doesn't survive contact with the speed and authority of AI generated content. The training requires someone who understands *in practice* what to check first, how to find counter sources, and how to spot AI overconfidence.

### 3. Ethical Judgment and Responsible Use

This competency addresses integrity, intellectual ownership, responsibility for biases and consequences, and considerations of fairness and transparency. In the AI era, where "AI plagiarism" blurs the line between help and cheating, students face genuine moral confusion: when does prompting become replacing? What counts as original work? What is the responsibility when AI output contains bias?

Literature on [moral character education](https://doi.org/10.1080/01626620.2016.1194785) (Lapsley & Woodbury, 2016) shows small to moderate positive effects from character education programs, but emphasizes that what matters most is **consistency, relationship, climate, and the role of meaningful adults.** Moral development isn't about memorizing rules. It's about practicing judgment in real situations.

James Rest's [Four Component Model](https://doi.org/10.4324/9781410601162) (moral sensitivity, judgment, motivation, action) reinforces this: ethical behavior requires all four components working together, and each must be practiced, not just understood conceptually.

Research on student perceptions of teacher authenticity shows that students judge teachers on **competence, commitment, coherence, and care**. When there's a gap between what a teacher preaches and what they practice (for instance, banning student AI use while quietly using it themselves) students interpret this as unfairness and hypocrisy.

> See: [Teacher credibility and student engagement](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.712419) (Zheng, 2021), on how perceived credibility affects student engagement.

**Why embodiment matters:** A teacher who hasn't wrestled with AI ethics boundaries personally (When is using AI for lesson planning different from students using AI for assignments? Where does "help" end and "replacement" begin?) will default to abstract rules that don't survive contact with real dilemmas. Students need to see adults making authentic judgment calls in gray areas and explaining their reasoning. The ethical dimension is perhaps the competency where embodiment is closest to being mandatory: you cannot teach integrity by policy document alone.

### 4. Adaptive Learning Under Uncertainty

This is the capacity for self regulated learning (SRL), meta-learning, epistemic humility, and willingness to update one's own practices. In a landscape where AI tools evolve monthly and yesterday's best practice may be obsolete, the ability to learn adaptively is not optional.

Meta-analyses on SRL and metacognition show that interventions improve strategies, achievement, and motivation. But SRL is best learned when the teacher **models** monitoring, planning, and quality evaluation, not just asks students to "be reflective."

Emerging research (2024 to 2025) documents teachers using ChatGPT for self directed professional development. These teachers used AI as a mirror for professional reflection: generating lesson plans, then critically analyzing the output, identifying pedagogical gaps, and refining their own practice. This is exactly what adaptive learning looks like in action.

Donald Schon's concept of *reflection in action* describes professional competence as the ability to navigate unique, uncertain, conflictual situations in real time. GenAI creates exactly this kind of uncertainty: Is the output reliable? Is the comparison fair? What counts as original work? The AI era makes the "reflective practitioner" a foundational requirement rather than an aspiration.

**Why embodiment matters:** A teacher who says "stay curious and keep learning" but hasn't personally navigated the discomfort of AI challenging their own expertise sends a contradictory message. Adaptive learning under uncertainty requires showing vulnerability: admitting "I don't know, let's check together," updating one's position when evidence shifts, and treating professional growth as continuous practice rather than a one time workshop.

### 5. Keeping the Human Above the Machine

This is the integration point: human judgment as the final authority, creativity and moral responsibility at the center, and the relational trust between teachers and students as the infrastructure that makes learning possible.

A [35-year meta-analysis on teacher trust](https://doi.org/10.1177/0013161X231183662) (Sun, Zhang & Forsyth, 2023) shows a consistent, moderate positive relationship between trust and learning outcomes. In a system where epistemic authority is shifting from teacher to algorithm, trust becomes the critical infrastructure. It determines whether students adopt thinking norms or see them as performance.

Research on social and emotional learning (SEL) shows positive effects on both social-emotional outcomes and academic achievement. The relational dimension of teaching (care, connection, safety to fail) cannot be automated. It is precisely in the relationship between teacher and student that norms about intellectual honesty, responsible use, and human agency are transmitted.

The consensus across research is clear: AI should enhance human learning, not automate it. Teachers remain irreplaceable for judgment, emotional connection, and contextualization. Effective AI era pedagogy treats AI as a tool under human oversight, keeping creativity, curiosity, empathy, and moral responsibility central while routine tasks are offloaded.

**Why embodiment matters:** This competency is inherently relational: trust, agency, and responsibility cannot be delegated to any system. A teacher who uncritically accepts AI outputs, avoids engaging with the technology, or delegates core pedagogical functions to AI undermines the very principle they're supposed to embody. Students learn whether humans or machines hold final authority by watching what the teacher does, not what the teacher says. The hidden curriculum here is profound: if the teacher treats AI as the authority, students will do the same.

## The Philosophical Foundation

Three traditions frame the argument across all five competencies:

| Thinker | Key Idea | Application in the AI Era |
|---|---|---|
| **John Dewey** | Learning is reconstruction of experience. Quality depends on the experience itself, not just correct declarations | Teachers need genuine AI experiences (including failures) to develop adaptive habits, not just conceptual understanding |
| **Paulo Freire** | Praxis means unity of reflection and action. You can't just talk about criticality | AI can turn both teachers and students into passive consumers of "ready-made text"; praxis demands active struggle with that temptation |
| **Donald Schon** | Professional competence is reflection in action: navigating unique, uncertain, conflictual situations | GenAI creates exactly this kind of uncertainty (Is the output reliable? Is the comparison fair? What counts as original work?), making the "reflective practitioner" a foundational requirement |

---

## What "Sufficient Embodiment" Looks Like

The research doesn't demand that every teacher become an AI power user. It defines a pragmatic middle ground, **enough practice to be authentic across all five competencies:**

1. **Practice questioning AI:** know from experience how questions evolve from vague prompts to precise inquiry chains, and how different framings produce different results
2. **Encounter AI errors personally:** develop lived familiarity with hallucinations, confident sounding mistakes, and subtle biases so that critical evaluation becomes a practiced reflex, not a theoretical concept
3. **Navigate ethical gray areas:** wrestle with real dilemmas about AI use, intellectual ownership, and fairness so that value based discussions come from lived experience, not policy documents
4. **Model adaptive learning:** continuously update practice through deliberate AI engagement, showing students what it looks like to learn, fail, adjust, and grow, not in one time workshops, but as ongoing professional habit
5. **Hold the human line:** demonstrate through daily behavior that human judgment, relationships, and responsibility remain above the machine, that AI is a tool under human authority, not a replacement for thinking

### What This Means for Each Competency

| Competency | What Embodiment Adds |
|---|---|
| **Question Formulation & Inquiry** | Not just teaching "good questions" but showing how to refine, iterate, and turn a question into a verification process when working with AI. Demonstrating how inquiry unfolds messily: confusion, rephrasing, dead ends, breakthroughs |
| **Critical Evaluation of AI Output** | Building "epistemic suspicion" through personal encounters with convincing AI errors. Modeling lateral reading, source triangulation, hallucination detection in real time rather than as abstract advice |
| **Ethical Judgment & Responsible Use** | Applying the same rules you set for students. Making judgment calls in gray areas transparently. Showing that integrity is practiced, not just preached. Character education research shows moral development requires consistency, relationship, and mediation |
| **Adaptive Learning Under Uncertainty** | SRL research supports modeling of monitoring and control. The teacher shows how they update their own knowledge, admit uncertainty, and treat professional growth as a continuous process. Epistemic humility in action |
| **Keeping the Human Above the Machine** | This is inherently relational: trust, agency, responsibility. The teacher demonstrates through behavior (not just words) that human judgment holds final authority. Students learn norms about AI's role by watching what teachers do |

## What's Strong and What's Still Emerging

### Well Established (broad research base):
- Cognitive apprenticeship and making thinking visible as effective pedagogy
- Explicit instruction outperforms immersion for critical thinking development
- SRL and metacognition interventions improve strategies and outcomes
- Transfer requires deliberate design (hugging, bridging, reflection)
- Moral character education works best through consistency, climate, and modeling
- Teacher trust and credibility correlate with student engagement and learning

### Emerging (2023 to 2026; more surveys and field studies than RCTs):
- Frequent GenAI use correlates with reduced critical thinking (but causality is unproven)
- Targeted inoculation training can increase verification behavior
- Teachers using ChatGPT for professional development show reflective growth when structured properly
- Teacher "trust negotiations" around GenAI adoption show value of collective, experiential professional development

### The Key Gap
There are **no direct comparative studies** measuring: *Do students develop the five competencies better when their teachers have personally practiced them vs. teachers who only understand them conceptually?* The evidence is mechanism based (cognitive apprenticeship, modeling, transfer theory, moral development) rather than direct experimental proof. This is the most valuable open research question in the field.

## The Bottom Line

**Option A** (understand and design activities) may work for isolated, one off lessons. But in an AI saturated environment, it's vulnerable to five points of failure, one for each competency:

1. **Inquiry becomes shallow:** Without a teacher who models real questioning, students learn to prompt and accept rather than investigate and verify.

2. **Critical evaluation stays theoretical:** Students hear "check your sources" but never see what checking actually looks like against fluent, authoritative AI output.

3. **Ethics becomes policy, not practice:** Abstract rules about AI use collapse when students face real dilemmas. Without a teacher who has navigated these gray areas, ethical guidance rings hollow.

4. **Adaptive learning is preached, not demonstrated:** Telling students to "stay curious" while the teacher avoids engaging with AI sends a contradictory message about learning under uncertainty.

5. **Human authority erodes silently:** Students infer from teacher behavior whether humans or machines hold final judgment. If the teacher defers to AI or avoids it, the principle of "human above machine" becomes empty rhetoric.

**The sustainable path is sufficient embodiment across all five competencies:** teachers who practice enough to model the questioning, demonstrate the evaluation, navigate the ethics, embody the adaptation, and hold the human line, not as AI experts, but as authentic epistemic mentors navigating the same uncertain landscape as their students.
