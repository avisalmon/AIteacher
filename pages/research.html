                                <p>The problem is not the technology itself, but how it is used and the context around it. Schools that focus on promoting academic integrity, student motivation, and engaging assignments see no spike in plagiarism even when AI is accessible. This suggests education about responsible use works better than bans.</p>

                                <p class="quote">"Now I understand how AI works... I feel confident to keep teaching AI on my own."</p>
                                <p>Teachers reported increased confidence and a sense of empowerment after participating in the co-creation process. This suggests that involving teachers in framework design leads to better buy-in and implementation.</p>

                                <p>While this foundational paper predates generative AI, its principles have never been more relevant. The cognitive apprenticeship model explains why teacher modeling is essential for developing thinking skills and provides the theoretical basis for effective AI integration in education.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Making expert thinking visible:</strong> In traditional apprenticeship, learners see the physical process of work. In schooling, the cognitive processes are hidden. Teachers must explicitly model how to approach complex tasks for students to develop those internal skills.</p>

                                        <li><strong>Coaching:</strong> Teacher observes and offers feedback</li>
                                        <li><strong>Scaffolding:</strong> Support that is gradually removed</li>

                                <h4>Why This Matters for AI</h4>
                                <p>When a teacher models how to evaluate AI output, thinking aloud about what might be wrong, cross checking facts, and identifying bias, students develop those same critical evaluation skills. This research explains why simply telling students to "be skeptical of AI" is far less effective than showing them how to be skeptical through demonstrated practice.</p>
