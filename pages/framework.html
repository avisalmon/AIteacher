                <p class="section-intro">These are the essential "Human Operating System" skills that enable individuals to function effectively and responsibly in a world saturated with AI. Click each competency to learn more.</p>

                        </button>
                        <div class="accordion-content">
                            <p>The ability to ask clear, focused, and generative questions to drive learning. In an AI context, this translates to skillful prompting of AI systems, knowing how to phrase questions or tasks to get useful output.</p>
                            <p>At a deeper level, this is about intellectual curiosity and inquiry based learning. Good questioning is a key component of critical thinking. The ability to formulate questions ties to metacognition, where learners ask themselves what they need to know.</p>
                            <p><strong>In practice:</strong> Students and teachers who master this competency can generate testable questions for investigation, craft effective prompts, and understand how question phrasing affects the answers they receive.</p>

                        <div class="accordion-content">
                            <p>The ability to analyze and evaluate information and outputs from AI with a critical lens. This means detecting errors, biases, misinformation (often called "hallucinations"), and not accepting AI responses as authoritative.</p>
                            <p>This draws on traditional critical thinking and information literacy. It involves treating AI as a non authoritative source by default, cross checking facts, identifying potential bias or missing perspectives, and recognizing when AI outputs lack logical coherence.</p>
                            <p><strong>In practice:</strong> A critical student will verify an AI generated "fact" against trusted sources. A teacher demonstrating this might say, "ChatGPT's answer sounds confident, but let's inspect its reasoning for flaws."</p>

                            <p>Understanding and applying principles of ethical behavior when using AI. This includes respecting privacy (not sharing sensitive data with AI tools), awareness of fairness and bias issues, maintaining academic integrity, and acknowledging the broader social impact of AI.</p>
                            <p>This competency encompasses digital citizenship and moral reasoning. Students must learn to cite AI assistance properly, avoid misrepresenting AI's work as their own, and consider how AI might reinforce stereotypes or exacerbate inequality.</p>
                            <p><strong>In practice:</strong> Students demonstrate academic integrity with AI by including a statement of how they used it. Teachers model ethical use by being transparent about when they use AI in lesson preparation.</p>

                            <p>Adaptability, continuous learning, and the capacity to manage one's learning in the face of rapid technological change. This aligns with metacognition ("learning how to learn") and lifelong learning skills.</p>
                            <p>In an AI world, tools and conditions change constantly. Today's ChatGPT might be obsolete next year; a new AI tool might disrupt a profession overnight. Both teachers and students need cognitive flexibility to update their skills and knowledge continuously.</p>
                            <p><strong>In practice:</strong> Students partake in metacognitive activities, keeping learning journals noting when they used AI and how it helped or hindered. Teachers model being learners themselves, openly exploring new tools with their classes.</p>

                            <p>Valuing and leveraging distinctly human attributes: creativity, curiosity, emotional intelligence, empathy, accountability, and values. This means ensuring humans retain agency and authority over machines.</p>
                            <p>Students and teachers should maintain a sense of human agency and responsibility over AI outputs and decisions. It's the ability to assert human judgment where AI might offer a shortcut, and to inject human qualities that AI lacks.</p>
                            <p><strong>In practice:</strong> Students iterate on AI generated content and add personal touches or novel ideas. Group projects emphasize collaboration and human creativity. Assessments evaluate the originality of ideas and personal expression, not just final answers.</p>
