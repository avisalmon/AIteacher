> Empowering educators with AI competencies to cultivate the next generation of critical, ethical, and adaptive learners.

## 🎯 Vision

In an AI-saturated educational environment, teachers must be both **competent practitioners** of AI and **skilled cultivators** of essential human competencies in their students. This project aims to bridge that gap.

## 📚 Background

This project is grounded in comprehensive research on AI in education, synthesizing evidence from:
- UNESCO's AI Competency Framework for Teachers
- OECD's AI Literacy Framework
- Global case studies (Finland, Singapore, China, UAE, USA)
- Meta-analyses on AI's impact on learning outcomes

## 🧠 Core Competencies ("Human Operating System")

The project focuses on developing five essential competencies:

1. **Question Formulation / Prompting as Inquiry** — The art of asking good questions
2. **Critical Thinking Toward AI Outputs** — Detecting errors, hallucinations, and bias
3. **Ethics and Responsible Use** — Privacy, integrity, fairness, and accountability
4. **Future-Oriented Thinking** — Adaptability, metacognition, and lifelong learning
5. **Keeping the Human Above the Machine** — Creativity, agency, and human values
